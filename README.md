**Step 1: Setup MIMIC-SPARQL and get access to MIMIC data**

Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/junwoopark92/mimic-sparql to get access to MIMIC and download the code we modified to create our system.

**Step 2: Build MIMIC-IV Database**

The MIMIC-SPARQL system is based on MIMIC-III, but we use MIMIC-IV, so you need to use the import script here: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/main/mimic-iv/buildmimic/sqlite to create a SQLITE database from the raw CSV files.
